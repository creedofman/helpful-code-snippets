### personal snippet repository

Each folder contains a readme.md with descriptions on that folder's contents.

- /misc contains other *misc* scripts  
- /gam contains scripts that I have written to help automate use of [Google Apps Manager](https://github.com/jay0lee/GAM)  
- /jamf contains scripts, snippets, launchagents, etc. that I find useful for managing [jamfPRO](https://www.jamf.com/)

Feel free to use or change any of the scripts or snippets you find, and I'd love to know if you make anything better or find problems! These are typically things that I use and work for me and my specific use-case scenarios, so no guarantee that anything will work for you like it does for me.
